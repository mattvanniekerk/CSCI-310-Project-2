1) I finished creating the json file of papers.
2) Work with Brian to request data from IEEE Xplore and use it to create the word cloud.
3) Since we're inexperienced, we aren't sure what the easiest and fastest route to our goal is. I finished the json file, but now we're probably not gonna use it at all anyway. If we make more mistakes like this, we'll waste time.
