1)Author search with our dummy database now works correctly. We can search for an author and generate a word cloud for him/her.
2)WELLLLL I was gonna put that I was gonna figure out how to correctly feed the data into the paper_list.php page, but I just finished that. However since I finished it AFTER the scrum and I'm just writing this a little late cause I was so busy working on it, I"m just gonna put it here and say that it counts.
