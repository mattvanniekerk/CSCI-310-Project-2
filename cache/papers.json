INTRODUCTION\rPerspective direction of development of the modern radio engineering systems and first of all telecommunication systems consists in simultaneous use of several frequency bands according to available standards. During realization of such systems there are problems, related to considerable complication of structure, with growth of overall sizes and cost. The way of their decision consists in application of dual band microwave devices, which provides the set values of operating parameters on central frequencies of two different frequency bands. Much attention is paid at that to design of passive devices of microwave integrated circuits. Relatively narrow frequency bands of telecommunication standards allow to go out from the values of central frequencies fi (i=1, 2) of these bands at the calculations of passive devices and to consider their as the dual-frequency devices. The frequency coefficient which is determined through the relation of frequencies kf=f2\/f1 (f2>f1 as a rule) is one of basic parameters of such device. Microwave devices of a signal distribution such as power dividers, directional couplers and hybrids, belong to the most important components of high-frequency networks. In the majority of famous publications the design methods of such devices with identical working parameters in each of frequency bands are considered. It concerns, for example, the equal [1] and unequal [2, 3, 4] dual-band power dividers, branch-line couplers [5, 6], ring hybrids [5]. The miscellaneous division of power in bands is considered only for different versions of two-branch couplers [7 \u2013 9] and for one option of the rat-race coupler [8]. Therefore it is very important to solve the task of a different distribution of power in different bands of frequencies.\rRealization of dual-frequency devices foresees the use of circuit elements which are dependent upon frequency. Due to the change of electrical parameters of them at transition from the first frequency f1 to the second f2 the necessary operating parameters of device are arrived at. One of approaches to development of dual-frequency devices is based on the use of method of equivalent replacement. By this method the circuit of the similar single-frequency device is chosen and stage-by- stage replacement of its elements dependent upon frequency (basic elements) by new dual-frequency elements is carried out. These elements provide the same parameters, as the basic elements, but only at two frequencies. Such approach is used for power dividers and also for branch-line and rat-race couplers where each quarter wave segment of line is replaced by equivalent segment of the connected lines [3] or by equivalent T-network formed by segment of line with stub in centre [4, 5]. The P-network formed by segment of the line with stubs at the edges is used in [8, 9] for a two-branch-line coupler in process of the equivalent replacement of its basic segments with different values of characteristic impedance for different frequencies, but with identical electrical length, equal only to 900, what creates the restrictions at the design of dual- band devices with arbitrary power division ratios.\rIn work the approach allowing to develop the methods of calculation of various symmetric circuits for the equivalent replacement of a segment of line with different characteristic impedances and different electrical lengths for two different frequencies is offered, the using of which it is shown on the examples of T- and P-network. Such circuits are necessary for design of dual-band devices with arbitrary division of power in different frequency bands. II. DEVELOPMENT OF EQUIVALENT DUAL-FREQUENCY CIRCUITS\rFor effective use of equivalent replacement method it is necessary to have a number of various variants of circuits together with calculation formulas.\rA. Principleofbasicsegmentreplacementwiththecircuit\rThe deduce of expressions for calculation of equivalent circuit is considerably simplified, if it is a reactive symmetric two-port network, what allows to use the method of input impedances of reduced partial circuits received by even-odd excitation [10]. In this case, unlike a well-known approach with equating of matrixes elements (conductivities or resistances) of the basic segment and equivalent circuit, the equating of corresponding input impedances is required. At such equivalent replacement the expressions for input reactances Xe1, Xo1 of partial circuits of even-odd excitation of equivalent circuit at the first operating frequency f1 are equated with the expressions for input reactances Xte1, Xto1 of partial circuits of even-odd excitation of basic segment at this frequency, and the expressions for input reactances Xe2, Xo2 at the second operating frequency f2 are equated with expressions for input reactances Xte2, Xto2, which correspond to frequency f2. Farther the expressions for calculation of two values of electrical parameters of elements of equivalent circuit for frequencies f1 and f2 via parameters of basic segment are deduced from these equalities.\rB. Circuitsforreplacementoftransmissionlinesegment\rBy a basic element depending from frequency in the structure of unequal microstrip devices for distributing of power there is transmission line segment, the values of characteristic impedance and electrical length of which depend on the power division ratio. Each such basic segment is the symmetrical two-port network with different values of characteristic impedance Zti and of electrical length  ti at two frequencies fi (i=1, 2). Its partial circuits of even-mode and odd-mode decomposition are formed by open and short halves of segment. The input reactances of these partial circuits can be obtained as follows:\rXtei=-Zti\/tti, Xtoi=Ztitti, (1) were t =tan(  \/2). The same input reactances have to be provided at partial components of the equivalent circuit.\rEquivalent T-type circuit consists of two transmission line segments with the electrical length  i at frequencies fi and with characteristic impedance Z and also of shunt reactance Xi, included between lines. In this case the expressions for input reactances of partial circuits of even-mode and odd-mode excitations write down as Xei = Z(2Xi +Zti )\/(Z \u22122Xiti ),\rX oi = Zt i , were ti=tan( i). From equating these expressions to expressions (1) the final design equations were derived:\rXi = Z(Zti + Ztitti )\/[2(Ztiti \u2212 Ztti )], A=tan(\u03b8 )\/tan(\u03b8 )=tan(\u03b8 )\/tan(k \u03b8 ),\r(2) (3)\r121f1\rwere A = Z t \/(Z t ), k \u2013 the frequency coefficient. t1 t1 t2 t2 f Here it is accepted that  2=kf 1 from condition that kf=f2\/f1  2\/ 1 where  i are phase constants of line at frequencies fi. The value of  1 may be found from (3) by iterative calculations.\rEquivalent P-type circuit consists of transmission line segment with the electrical length  i at frequencies fi and with characteristic impedance Z and also of two shunt reactances Xi which are included to the edges of line. Expressions for input reactances of partial circuits of even-odd excitations write down as Xei =XiZ\/(Z\u2212Xiti), Xoi =XiZti \/(Xi +Zti),\rwere ti =tan( i\/2). The equating of these expressions to expressions (1) gives two expressions for Xi:\rXi =ZZti \/(Ztiti \u2212Ztti), Xi =ZZtititti \/(Zti \u2212Ztitti). (4) And the equating of expressions for Xi gives the formula for Z: Z=Zti sin(\u03b8ti)\/sin(\u03b8i). (5)\rThe equating at different values of index i of formulas (5) gives the equality:\rA = s i n (\u03b8 1 ) \/ s i n (\u03b8 2 ) = s i n (\u03b8 1 ) \/ s i n ( k f \u03b8 1 ) ,\rwere A=Zt1sin(\u03b8t1)\/[Zt2sin(\u03b8t2)]. As in previous case the\rvalue of  1 may be found from (6) by iterative calculations.\rDual-frequency reactance accepting different values Xi at different frequencies fi enter (one or several) to each of equivalent circuits given above. Such elements may be realized by circuit the input reactance of which is equal to Xi values. This circuit most often is formed by discrete elements, a transmission line stub or connection of line's segments. The electrical parameters depending from frequency are necessary in circuit to provide the different values of input reactance at the changing of frequency. When the line stub (characteristic impedance Zs, electrical length  si) loaded by the Xki reactance is used, its electrical length  s1 may be found from the equality: tan\u03b8 (X \u2212X )(Z +X X ) s1 = 1 k1 s 2 k2 , (7) tan(kf\u03b8s1) (X2 \u2212Xk2)(Zs +X1Xk1) where value Zs is chosen so that to satisfy simultaneously the equality tan\u03b8 =Z (X \u2212X )\/(Z2 +X X ). When Xki=0 s1 s 1 k1 s 1 k1 (the shorted end of stub) then Zs=X1\/tan( s1) and when Xki=  (the open end of stub) then Zs=-X1tan( s1). When the combinations of values X1, X2 give negative value of Zs the stepped impedance section can be used, where the load Xki is the input reactance of second segment of line.\rIII. PROCEDURE OF EQUIVALENT REPLACEMENT AND EXAMPLES OF ITS USING\rProcess of design of a microstrip device by a method of equivalent replacement is carried out in such sequence. 1) The known version of the single-frequency circuit of power distribution device similar to the required device is chosen. 2) Based from preset values of division power ratios ki at frequencies fi the parameters Zti,  ti of all basic line segments in composition of chosen circuit are calculated for both fi by using known methods of single-frequency circuit calculation. 3) The electrical parameters of elements of the chosen equivalent circuit for every basic segment are calculated: the value  1 is found by iteration method from (3) or (6) and after that the values Z and Xi are calculated from (2) or (4) and (5). -10 4) For the chosen variant of load with reactance Xki the segment parameters providing the input reactance Xi are found from (7).The dependences of scattering parameters of symmetrical circuit from the input impedances of its partial components are -30 shown [11], that the change of sign of reactive components of input impedances leads to change of the phase's signs of scattering parameters, but their modules do not change and the distributing of power between outputs of circuit remains the same. Therefore, if to change a sign of  ti at one of frequencies, it causes the change of signs Xtei, Xtoi and leads to other variant of the electrical parameters of equivalent circuit's elements, at which preset operating parameters of device will be provided. The design of unequal Wilkinson power divider and of rat- race ring coupler is considered as the examples of using the offered method. Different values of power division ratios ki=2.0\/1.0 at average frequencies fi=2.0\/3.6 GHz of two bands were preset for these devices. The equivalent replacement by P-type circuits was carried out for power divider. In case of rat-race coupler the equivalent replacement by T-type circuits with change of  t2 sign, that is  t2=- \/2, was used. Fig. 1 shows the scattering parameters received at the power divider simulation. The results of dual-frequency rat-race coupler simulation are shown in Fig. 2. It is visible that the change of a sign  t2 changes on opposite a sign of output signal phase at f2, but division of power corresponds to set. Characteristics of basic single-frequency devices calculated for k1=2.0 at first frequency f1 are shown by dotted line in Figures. Fig. 1. Scattering parameters of power divider. IV. CONCLUSION The received expressions allow to design the dual-band devices with an arbitrary distribution of power in frequency bands. The expressions for other variants of dual-frequency equivalent two-pole circuit which are necessary for replacement of line segment with different values of electrical parameters at two frequencies can be written down by offered way.

INTRODUCTION\rModern wireless communication systems require high operation efficiency and high harmonic suppression level resulting in lower power consumption, size and cost. This can be achieved by using switching-mode Class-E [1] or Class-F [2] power amplifiers (PAs). The single-ended switching-mode power amplifier with a shunt capacitor was introduced and described in details as a Class-E power amplifier in mid-70s and has found widespread application due to its design simplicity and high operation efficiency [1, 3]. There are different configurations of Class-E PA: conventional Class E with shunt capacitance, Class E with finite dc-feed inductance, or Class-E with quarterwave transmission line [4]. Besides, there are many implementations of broadband Class-E PA using reactance-compensation or filtering techniques [5, 6]. All types of Class-E PA are based on common optimum switching conditions regardless of their schematic realization: drain voltage and drain voltage derivative become zero prior to the moment of switch \"ON\". Thus, there is no power dissipation in the switch and efficiency ideally reaches 100%.\rEach type of Class-E PA consists of the active device operating as a switch and the load network that can be designed in different configurations. In this paper, an experimental investigation of high-frequency Class-E PA with shunt filter and lumped-element load network is presented. Actually, the first results for switching-mode Class-E PA with shunt filter were demonstrated in the late 60-s for particular case and based on vacuum tube as an active device [7]. Much more detailed approaches to design Class-E power amplifier with shunt filter including transmission-line implementation and broadband capability within frequency band from 1.7 to 2.7 GHz achieving the output power of about 40.6 dBm and average drain efficiency of 68% were described in [8]. But generally there is a lack of practical implementations of the lumped-element load-networks for Class-E PA with shunt filter.\rThus, the objective of this work is to experimentally test Class-E PA with shunt filter at high frequency with lumped- element load network and to determine main sources of power loss and their contribution to overall efficiency.\rII. CIRCUIT ANALYSIS\rThe circuit schematic of a Class-E PA with shunt filter is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of the switching power MOSFET device VT1, RF choke (Lchoke) that allows only dc current to flow through dc voltage source, shunt capacitance C, series inductance L, dc-blocking capacitor Cb, which is assumed to have relatively high capacitance to present very low impedance at operating frequency, shunt L0C0 filter, series reactance X, and load resistance Rload [8].\rSeries reactance X can be negative \u2013 capacitance, equal to zero, or positive \u2013 inductance, and also can represent some type of parasitic elements of load-network real components. The shunt L0C0 filter is tuned to the fundamental frequency having infinite impedance at this frequency and zero- impedance at harmonics. As in conventional Class-E power amplifier, the shunt capacitance C consists of internal drain- source capacitance of active device and external capacitance.\rIn theoretical analysis, it is assumed that\r- the transistor has zero saturation voltage, zero saturation resistance, infinite off-resistance, and its switching is instantaneous and lossless\r- the series reactance X = 0\r- the shunt capacitance is assumed to be constant\r- the shunt L0C0 filter has zero impedance at harmonics - there is no loss in the circuit except the load Rload\r- 50% duty ratio is used. Fig. 1.\rAs a result of the theoretical analysis, the following design equations for the load-network parameters are obtained:\rV2 Rload   0.4281 dc P\rout\r L R   1.4836  CR   0.261\rL0   R   Q \rwhere Q is the quality factor of shunt L0C0 filter and     2 f is\rthe radian operating frequency [8]. In this case, the optimum switching Class-E conditions are satisfied at operating frequency, and the maximum amplitude of the drain voltage is 3.677 times of dc-supply voltage that is similar to that in conventional Class-E PA. Besides, for each active device with its intrinsic drain-source capacitance Cout, the maximum operating frequency is 1.91 times greater than that for conventional Class-E PA and can be obtained by [8]\rf   0.097 P\rmax outC V2\rThe initial operation conditions are as follow: operating frequency of 13.56 MHz, dc-supply voltage of 12 V, output power of 5 W, and load-network quality factor Q = 5. An active device is power MOSFET IRF520 with its internal output capacitance of about 150 pF and the maximum allowable drain-source voltage of 100 V [9].\r40\r30\r20\r1,0\r0,5\r0 . 1 5 u F   \rC 0   6,0 L0 LR 5,5\rOutput power, W\rDrain voltage, V\rDrain current, A\rDrain efficiency, %\rFig. 2.\rThe values of the load-network elements calculated\raccording to the design equations are written as Rload = 12.3  , L=214.7nH,C=100pF,L0 =28.9nH,C0 =4760pF. The circuit schematic of the load network of Class-E PA with parasitic elements is shown in Fig. 2.\rHere, the parasitic resistances of inductor L and dc- blocking capacitor Cb are presented by Rseries. The parasitic resistances of the elements of shunt L0C0 filter are given by RL0 and RC0, and the parasitic inductance of the load resistor is shown by LR.\rIII. SIMULATION OF AMPLIFIER\rSimulation of Class-E PA with shunt filter was fulfilled using ADS harmonic balance simulator with the switch model for active device having the on-state resistance of 0.15  . The simulated drain voltage and current waveforms at operating frequency are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Drain voltage and current simulated waveforms.\rAs can be seen, the drain voltage and drain voltage derivative are zero prior to the moment of switch \"ON\", thus demonstrating that the idealized optimum or nominal Class-E switching conditions are satisfied.\rThe output power and drain efficiency versus frequency are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the simulated output power is 4.96 W with 98.8% drain efficiency at operating frequency of 13.56 MHz. Fig. 4.\rSimulated output power and efficiency. \rIV. EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION\rFrom design equation for the series and shunt inductances it follows that their values in Class-E PA with shunt filter are much less than the corresponding values for conventional Class-E PA at the same operating frequency and they are equal to 214.7 nH and 28.9 nH, respectively. In this case, to make design more convenient in implementation and to minimize losses and parasitic elements shown in Fig. 2, special technical approaches were used in experimental prototype under its practical implementation. The experimentally obtained drain and load voltage waveforms are shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the drain voltage waveform corresponds to the nominal switching Class-E conditions. Fig. 5.\rExperimental drain and load voltage waveforms. In practical implementation, first the load resistor was made of 40 SMD resistors connected in parallel to minimize the series lead inductance. These resistors are attached to the small-size PCB on one side, while the mica capacitor C0 is connected to the load by wide conductors at the other side. Mica capacitor type is \"KSO\" and its ESR at operating frequency is not more than 0.07   [10]. The inductance L0 represents one turn of silver-coated wire and placed close to C0 between its leads to minimize additional inductances. Hence, the L0C0Rload filter is realized as a separate unit, as shown in Fig. 6, and its parameters can be adjusted individually. L0C0Rload filter construction. The capacitor C is connected directly to the drain of the power MOSFET and inductor L is connected to the same point. Similar to inductor L0 it is made from silver-coated wire as well. The output power and drain efficiency versus frequency are shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7.\r11,5\r12,0\r12,5\r13,0 Frequency, MHz\r14,0\r14,5\r100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30\r15,0 15,5\r13,5\rExperimentally obtained output power and efficiency versus frequency. At operating frequency of 13.56 MHz this Class-E PA delivers 3.33 W to the load with 92.5% drain efficiency. As can be seen, the measured output power is slightly less than expected from simulation, which means that the simulation using simplified nonlinear model of MOSFET IRF520 cannot properly describe the behavior of nonlinear capacitances [9].\rIn addition, the parasitic resistances of shunt filter and inductance LR are included in PA simulation. Because the inductor L0 consists of one turn only, its parasitic resistance was not taken into account, and the parasitic resistance Rseries of inductor L is calculated to be 0.08  . As for parasitic inductance LR, it can be estimated to be equal to 20 nH due to technical features of experimental prototype. The simulation results of the output power and drain efficiency versus frequency are shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that these dependencies remain almost the same although with slightly lower values. Fig. 8. Simulated output power and drain efficiency using MOSFET model and lossy elements. In this case, Class-E PA delivers 3.7 W of output power with 85% drain efficiency.\rNext step is to calculate loss contribution of each parasitic resistance RC0 and Rseries. The loss due to RL0 was not taken into account because of very low inductance L0, with estimation that resistance is lower than 0.01  . The dissipation power in each resistor was simulated by measuring rms current flowing through each resistor according to\rP RI2 diss diss RMS\rAs the result, the final values of the dissipation powers are as follow: PRC0 = 0.536 W and PRseries = 0.032 W. It can be seen that, to minimize power losses in Class-E PA with shunt filter, the capacitor C0 should have extremely low tg .\rThus, it can be concluded that the series parasitic resistances of shunt L0C0 filter significantly decrease the output power and efficiency of Class-E PA with shunt filter and it becomes difficult to implement it at high frequencies using lumped-element load network. However, as an advantage, the simulation has shown 50 dB of second harmonic suppression at the load. Consequently, it could be useful to further investigate the lumped-element Class-E PA with shunt filter involving the parasitic reactive elements in its schematic.\rThe next step is to investigate power amplifier behavior with nonzero reactance X shown at Fig. 1, which can be negative or positive and represent capacitive or inductive part of load impedance. This can be parasitic parameters of load or reactive load like antenna. Several capacitors and inductors were put in experimental prototype schematic and their values were chosen to obtain X impedance from 0 to 2R for inductors and from -2R to 0 for capacitances. Then output power and drain efficiency were measured at central frequency of 13.56 MHz versus X\/R ratio. Also simulation of such dependences were obtained using ADS. These dependences are shown at Fig. 9.\rAs can be seen experimentally obtained and simulated data have similar dependences, except simulated output power in capacitive X part. It can be explained with using of ideal switch and ideal passive elements models without resistive losses in simulation.\rThus the range of reactance X in which there is none of significant amplifier characteristics decreasing is determined and it is approximately from -0.5R to 0.5R. So in the case of reactance X presence we have another one parameter that can be included in theoretical analysis of such scheme and can be deeply investigated.\rV. CONCLUSION\rIn this paper, the high-frequency Class-E power amplifier with shunt filter was designed, simulated, and experimentally tested. Special design features were used to minimize the values of the parasitic resistive parameters of the lumped- element load network. Experimental prototype of Class-E PA with shunt filter demonstrated 3.33 W of output power with 92.5% drain efficiency at 13.56 MHz. It is shown in simulation that even relatively small values of the parasitic resistive elements significantly decrease the quality factor of shunt L0C0 filter and entire characteristics of PA. In this case, the main source of losses is the capacitor of the shunt L0C0 tank and it is very important to choose this capacitor with as lower tg  as possible. Experimental investigation with reactance X 0 was held and the range of X\/R values in which characteristics of amplifier don\u2019t decrease was determined. So further investigation can include effects of nonzero X in theoretical analysis of class-E power amplifier with shunt filter.
