INTRODUCTIONMicrostrip filters are using in many radioelectronic sys- tems including wireless [1]. Modern development of the mi- crostrip technology largely link with the using of artificial materials — metamaterials and artificial structures with spe- cial characteristics [2]–[4]. Such structures include crystal-like structures with band properties similar to crystals. Microstrip crystal-like structures named electromagnetic crystals, as well as separate electromagnetic-crystal inhomogeneities (ECIs) are used in microstrip devices. In [5] the using of 3D ECIs as quasi-lumped reactive elements with a significant reactivity increasing compared with the conventional structures is pro- posed.On the basis of quasi-lumped reactive elements lowpass filters (LP) are constructed. Since for the given reactivities values the ECIs are smaller, their using in LP filters will re- duce filters sizes. Furthermore, as shown below, and the sup- pression of signals in stopband is improved significantly.In this paper the models of reactive elements, called δ-models, is offered and microstrip LP filter based on 3D ECIs is proposed and examined.II. COVENSIONAL MODELS OFREACTIVE ELEMENTSModels of lumped reactive elements use in the circuit withlumped parameters. In such circuit the inductance and capaci- tance are lumped on separate section with the length l. In cir- cuit with distributed parameters (transmission line (TL)) under certain conditions reactive elements can be considered as qua- si-lumped on separate sections of TL.Fig. 1 shows  - and T-like circuits, by which these sections are modeling. Quasi-lumped reactive element is realized by TL section.Under conditions l    , Z    Z0 and Z    Z0 , where  is the wavelength; Z and Z0 are the wave impedances of TLsection and TL, in  - and T-like circuits capacitors and induc- tors are not taken into account, respectively. As a result, it remains only series inductor and shunt capacitor.Fig. 1  - (a) and T-like (b) equivalent curcuits of TL sectionFor the given values of inductance L and capacitance C TL sections lengthes are defined as [2]: 1 L1lL   arcsin( c ), lC   arcsin( cCZC), kc ZL kc   where indexes «L» and «C» denoting inductance and capaci- tance; k 2 / ,   2 f ,fisthefrequency;index«c»de- noting cutoff frequency.III.DELTA MODELS OF REACTIVE ELEMENTS AND LOW-PASS FILTERS 978-1-5090-4409-2/16/$31.00 ©2016 IEEEFrequency limitation forelements by ratio l      isconventional   of reactive due to the finite dimensions of the elements. Model without such limitation is proposed below.Let’s consider the equivalent circuit for infinitely short TL section with the length dl (Fig. 2а). The values dL, dC, dr and dg are lumped infinitely small elements: inductance, capaci-modelstance, resistance and conductance, respectively. Resistance and conductance account losses. The inductance and capaci- tance equal:dL L dl, dC C dl, (1) where L  and C  are inductance and capacitance per unitlength.Fig. 2 Equivalent circuit of infinitly short TL section (a), finite dimension impedance barrier and well (b),  -barrier and  -well (c)Wave impedance and wave’s phase velocity ν in TL with- out losses are defined by expressions:Z  L , v  1 .

Fig. 3a demonstrates LP prototype filters with a ladder network structure and their dual (Fig. 3b) [2, 6]. Value gi for i=1 to n represents the inductance of series in-ductor or capacitance of shunt capacitor, n is the number of reactive elements. If g1 represents capacitance or inductance, then g0 is defined as the source resistance or conductance. Similarly, if gn ― capacitance or inductance, then gn+1 corre- sponds to the load resistance or conductance. Element values are normalized thus, that g0  1 and the angular cutoff fre-quency  c  1.The values of the filter inductances and capacitances arerelated with the values gi by formulas [5]:L Z0 cg, C g0 cg. (5) ig iiZ i 0c 0c    Taking into account Eqs (4) from Eqs (5) we get     gi .Thus, reactive elements  -models are directly related with the prototype-filter model.Fig. 3 LP prototype filtersFig. 4 depicts the  -models for filters with Butterworth (a) and Chebyshev (b) characteristics for circuit from Fig. 3b when n   3 and n   5 . Distance between reactive elements    With regard to Eqs (2) from Eqs (1) we get dL Zdl, dC dl.Fig. 2b shows finite dimension impedance barrier and well, where small symbols denoting the normalized to Z0 im- pedances; indexes «h» and «l» denoting high and low (regarding to 1) impedances.i kc  v Zv(3) Letting l dl, zh    zl  0 and besides that z dl    and z 1dl    , where   and   are constants.hLlСLСIn this case the finite dimension barrier and well will take the form of  -barrier and  -well (Fig. 2c), in Eqs (3) values dL and dC are finite and equal L and C, then Eqs (3) will take the formL  LZ0, C  C . (4) v Z0vAs we see from Eqs (4),  -barrier is equivalent to series inductor and  -well ― shunt capacitor. We will call these models of reactive elements as  -models. Unlike conventional approximate models of reactive elements,  -models are exact and without frequency limitation.Constant   determines the measure of reactivity of reac- tive element. In graphic image of the reactive element  -model the length of the  -function is directly proportional to the con- stant   value, so and to the inductance or capacitance values. Thus, unlike conventional graphical symbols of reactive ele- ments,  -models allows to represent the relations between cir- cuit reactances values.For finite dimension reactive elements constants  L and -models are shown imaginary. Values of gi are given in Table 1 [2].for these cases    Fig. 4 Delta-models for LP filters with Butterworth (a) and Chebyshev (b) characteristicsTABLE1VALUESOF giIV. LOWPASSFILTERConventional ECIs are 2D structures formed as holes or slits of different shapes in the metalized surface or in the sig- nal conductor [2, 7]. 3D ECIs are significantly more effective [4]. Inductive 3D ECI is formed by through hole in metalized surface and dielectric with a small-diameter conductor above it, and capacitive ― metalized non-through hole on signal conductor side or on metalized surface. Such ECIs represent first order LP filters.The inductor and capacitor can be combined in the con- struction of ECI, thereby increasing the order of the filter. Combined ECI are formed by non-through holes: ECI I ― on the signal conductor side (Fig. 6a), ECI II ― on the metalized surface (Fig. 6b, substrate is not shown) with a partial metali- zation of the hole. Signal conductor of non-metalized part of the hole is narrow. At ECI II the form of the signal conductor over the metalized part of the hole is the same as hole bottom form. Non-metalized and metalized parts of the hole corre- spond to inductor and capacitor. Combined ECI is equivalent to the second order filter (Fig. 7).ab Fig.6 Combined ECIsFig.7 Combined ECI equivalent circuitFig. 8 presents transfer characteristics of ECI with full- metalized hole (capacitance ECI, curve 1), and combined ECIs I and II (curve 2 and 3, respectively). Curve 4 ― transfer characteristic of ECI I with hole etched in metalized surface under the non-metalized part of the ECI. The parameters of ECIs: square-shaped hole with rounded angles, the length of square side is equal 5 mm, hole depth t = 0.9 mm, signal con- ductor width w = 0.1 mm, half hole is metalized. Substrate material ― Rogers RO3010, dielectric thickness 1.28 mm, relative dielectric constant 10.2, dielectric loss tangent 0.0023 at the frequency 10 GHz, metalization thickness 0.035 mm.As ECIs are 3D structures with complex geometry and boundary conditions it is necessary to use 3D electromagnetic simulators.

Taking into account the influence of capaci- tance in  -like circuit and inductance in T-like, which are notincluded in quasi-lumped elements models, the impedances of the finite dimension reactive elements are corrected: inductive reduced by 6.7 % and capacitive increased by 13.6 %.

Excluding external segments of signal conductor, lengthes of the conventional and proposed structure filters equal 26.7, and 17.2 mm, respectively, which corresponds to the decrease of the filter’s length by 1.6 times.

The calculated and experimental values of fmin and Hmin are equal 7.1 and 6.9 GHz,  33.5 and  33.0 dB, re-spectively.CONCLUSIONProposed  -models of reactive elements unlike conven- tional models do not have frequency limitation. Delta-models «suggest» decisions, which allow increasing the LF filter se- lectivity.Microstrip filters based on 3D ECIs provide a significant reduction in size, increasing bandstop cutoff frequency and reducing signal level in bandstop. Combined ECI allows inte- grated realiziation of the different character reactivities.Significant interest has got a research of based on ECIs higher orders LF filters and filters with other type characteristics.(/section)http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7739595(/section)@INPROCEEDINGS{7739595, author={E.
