Sushko(/section)2016 International Conference Radio Electronics & Info Communications (UkrMiCo)(/section)The work of L-type matching filters for different methods of detecting the PLL feedback signal and the filter parameter influence on oscillation amplitude of piezoelectric transducer are investigated in this research. The equivalent scheme of quadripole with mechanical resistance load composed of filter and a piezoelectric transducer is designed.The expressions for the input filter impedance and oscillation amplitude of piezoelectric transducer on the input voltage amplitude are obtained by the analysis of the T-shaped equivalent circuit. Relations for matching filter inductance for piezoelectric transducer working at the serial and parallel resonance frequencies are calculated analyzing the expression for the input impedance.Inappropriate use of L-type filter for piezoelectric transducer working at the serial resonance frequency is shown theoretically.The possibility of piezoelectric transducer operating mode with independent of the mechanical load amplitude of mechanical vibrations is given. The adequacy of mathematical modeling is confirmed by the experimental results.(/section)I. INTRODUCTIONUltrasonic equipment and technologies with high ultrasonic intensity are widely used in the microelectronics, in radio components and devices manufacturing [1 – 3]. The electromechanical transducer on the piezoceramic base – piezoelectric transducers are the most frequently used to obtain high-intensity ultrasound. Piezoelectric transducers have high electroacoustic efficiency, relatively low mechanical losses and enough mechanical strength after reinforcement. The piezoceramic devices are used as functional electronics devices – piezoelectric ultrasonic motors [4], piezoelectric transformers [5], actuators for positioning [6].The main disadvantages of piezoceramics are the presence of a large static capacitance, the dependence of parameters on time and temperature and mechanical load. The electromechanical piezoelectric transducer must operate at the frequency close to the mechanical resonance frequency toobtain high amplitudes of mechanical oscillations. In this case the electronic control circuit has not only to support the amplitude of piezoceramic transducer oscillations at a predetermined level, but also to compensate for its parameters changing. The reactance component of piezoelectric transducer impedance must be compensated to obtain high total efficiency of the electronic control circuit.II. PROBLEMSTATEMENTUltrasonic equipment consists of ultrasonic generator, ultrasonic piezoelectric transducer and matching filter. The analysis of the piezoelectric transducer equivalent circuit (fig.1) [7] shows that there are two resonant frequencies: the frequency of mechanical resonance frequency and parallel resonance frequency.The amplitude of the oscillations is proportional to the currentthroughtheresistorofmechanicalbranchRM .LМС0 СМ RМFig.1.

It performs two functions simultaneously: makes active transducer impedance on the operating frequency and serves as the source of a feedback signal to maintain a resonant operating mode of the piezoelectric transducer.Signal proportional to the current through the inputterminals of the matching filter (fig.2a) or through mechanicalbranch using differential current transformer T (fig.2b) can beused to detect a feedback signal U . fbIt could be considered that a static capacitance of piezoelectric transducer is equal to double value of capacity and current transformer does not introduce significant phase shifts and can be excluded analyzing schemes of matching filters with differential transformer. Maximum current criterion or criterion of phase shift between feedback signal and output voltage of ultrasonic generator could be used as criteria of resonant mode maintain since the current through the mechanical branch is proportional to the amplitude of the transducer oscillations.Different PLL implementations and matching filter schemes [8, 9] are used designing the ultrasonic generators [10—13]. So question of feedback signal detection and its influence on the piezoelectric transducer operation is uncovered insufficiently.The goal of the research is studying the feature of feedback signal detection in L-type matching filter and its influence on the amplitude of piezoelectric transducer oscillations.III.

Thus, detection of feedback signal is impossible through dependence of phase shift on load resistance in mechanical branch. Also the matching degree of generator and piezoelectric transducer will change. Matching can be achieved only at a certain load resistance.As a result it can be concluded that scheme with L-type matching filter should be used for transducer operation at the parallel resonance frequency. Normal operation of PLL system is possible only at a fixed value of the mechanical load working at the mechanical resonance frequency. Mismatch changing the mechanical load will take place working with ultrasonic generator with external excitation at mechanical resonance frequency.A comparative analysis of experimental and theoretical data for the piezoelectric transducer with operating frequency of 44 kHz is conducted.The experimental values of static capacitance, resonance and parallel resonance frequencies are calculated data for the equivalent circuit.C0  5.6nF; fR  44.05kHz; fP  44,65 kHz.

CONCLUSIONS.It is shown by the calculated and experimental data analysis that it is advisable to use a signal proportional to the input current filter as feedback signal for both types of filters. The mechanical branch current is shifted on 90 degrees relatively the input voltage. However, around the resonance frequency of the transducer high slope of the phase characteristic cannot be obtained. Therefore, using the feedback voltage proportional to the mechanical branch current as the feedback signal is not appropriate. The hypothesis of increasing the oscillation amplitude of the piezoelectric transducer with increase of static capacitance and reducing of filter inductances was confirmed by the results of experiments.The increasing of oscillation amplitude was controlled visually by the liquid spray to the surface of the piezoelectric transducer. A drop of liquid was applied to the end of transducer. Then the input voltage for spraying was picked up. Then the capacitor was connected in the parallel with input terminals of the piezoelectric transducer and inductor values of the filter were changed. After that the voltage observing the start of liquid spraying was chosen. As a result it was found that spraying started at significantly lower input voltage increasing the static capacitance.(/section)http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7739596(/section)@INPROCEEDINGS{7739596, author={A.
