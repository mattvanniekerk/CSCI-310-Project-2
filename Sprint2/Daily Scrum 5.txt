ANSWERS
Arman Akhbari
1) I finished editing most of the document.
2) Did pair programming with shokoufeh, but couldnt do much since we both are not familiar with coding.
3) Lack of knowledge in PHP, JavaScript API's will not let us program anything and that is hurting everybody.

1) Briefly looked into APIs we could use for the project. I think I might have found things we can use (search for papers,
convert pdf to text... is that even needed? I have no idea but I'm assuming you can't just scrape all the text off the thing
unless it's in plaintext, so maybe that's useful), but I have no idea how to actually have the project utilize them.
2) Try to figure out the problem mentioned in 1).
3) I really have no idea how to use APIs, and I'm also worried about having to split my coding time with my other CS course.

1) I had to spend all my time on a CSCI 356 assignment, so I did nothing in the last day to help the team reach the goal.
2) Update burndown chart; continue tutorials; try to connect APIs.
3) Insufficient knowledge and experience of PHP, JavaScript, APIs, and web development.
