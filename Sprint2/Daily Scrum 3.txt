1) Continued poking around the code, changed a few variable names to begin transitioning project 1 code to project 2 code.
Nothing serious at all, just a few superficial changes to begin adapting the code. Still no idea WTF I'm doing with it though,
especially because we haven't even gotten an API to get the papers off ACM/IEEE so we can't change anything else at the moment.
2) Will begin to research APIs we could use. Continue learning more front-end stuff
3) Assignments from other class might get in the way this weekend! Also this code is really confusing because I don't have
the necessary brainpower for it apparently
