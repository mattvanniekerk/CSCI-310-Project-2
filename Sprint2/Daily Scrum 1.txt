1) I determined what features should be implemented during the second sprint.
2) I researched on how to change the API of the search bar so we can search a researcher's last names instead of an artist.
3) Not having any previous knowledge in PHP is preventing me from understanding the previous code therefore I require more time to figure it out.

1) Began learning html and everything else needed for front-end changes (Mozilla Developer Network)
2) Continue through the tutorial, look through the code from project 1 to see what I can feasibly adapt for project 2. Will look toward specific features once sprint backlog is finalized
3) Frankly I don't want to do any back-end so I'll need to work with whoever does that to work on integrating the two together as we had an issue with that with project 1.

1) I worked on a Codecademy tutorial on PHP.
2) Today I will continue to work through the tutorial, so that I can implement appropriate adaptations in the back-end.
3) Iâ€™m worried that we will not be able to learn the appropriate expertise quickly enough to still have time to complete the implementation.
